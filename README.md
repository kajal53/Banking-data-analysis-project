# Banking Data Analysis Project

## Overview
This project focuses on analyzing banking data to uncover insights related to customer behavior, transactions, or financial trends. The goal is to perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) and create interactive visualizations using Python and a Power BI dashboard to derive actionable insights.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains banking-related information, such as customer details, transaction history, or account information. The dataset is typically stored in a CSV or Excel file (e.g., `banking_data.csv`) and includes columns like:
- Customer ID
- Account Balance
- Transaction Amount
- Transaction Date
- Customer Age, etc.

*Note*: For detailed dataset information, refer to the dataset file or documentation within the repository.

## Objectives
- Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand data distributions and patterns.
- Identify key trends, such as high-value transactions or customer demographics.
- Visualize insights using Python-based charts (e.g., histograms, bar plots, heatmaps) and an interactive Power BI dashboard.
- Provide actionable recommendations based on the analysis.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: Core programming language for data analysis.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **NumPy**: For numerical computations.
- **Matplotlib/Seaborn**: For data visualization in Python.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: For interactive analysis and documentation.
- **Power BI**: For creating an interactive dashboard to visualize key insights.

## Project Structure


## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/kajal53/Banking-data-analysis-project.git

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
    cd Banking-data-analysis-project
   
3. Install the required Python dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt

4. Launch the Jupyter Notebook for EDA:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook notebooks/analysis.ipynb


   For the Power BI dashboard:
Install Power BI Desktop (if not already installed).
Open the banking_dashboard.pbix file in the dashboard/ folder using Power BI Desktop.


## Usage
## 1. Python Analysis:
Open the analysis.ipynb notebook in the notebooks/ folder.
Follow the steps in the notebook to load the dataset, clean the data, and perform EDA.
Run the cells to generate visualizations (e.g., histograms, bar plots) and insights.
Optionally, use the data_processing.py script for automated data cleaning.

## 2. Power BI Dashboard:
Open the banking_dashboard.pbix file in Power BI Desktop.
Interact with the dashboard to explore visualizations like:
Customer segmentation by age or account balance.
Transaction trends over time.
Key metrics (e.g., total transactions, average balance).
Use filters and slicers in the dashboard for dynamic analysis.

## Example Analysis
Customer Segmentation: Group customers by age or account balance (visualized in both Python and Power BI).
Transaction Trends: Analyze transaction frequency over time (line charts in Power BI, plots in Python).
Visualizations:
Python: Histogram of account balances, bar chart of transaction types, correlation heatmap.
Power BI: Interactive dashboard with slicers, KPI cards, and trend visualizations.

## Results
The analysis provides insights such as:

Identification of high-value customers.
Trends in transaction volumes during specific periods.
Correlations between customer demographics and banking behavior.
Interactive dashboard for stakeholders to explore data dynamically.
